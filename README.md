This package includes GNAT Ada Run Time Systems (RTSs) based on
[FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org) and targeted at boards with
Cortex-M3, -M4, -M4F MCUs ([Arduino Due](http://www.arduino.org), the
STM32F4-series evaluation boards from
[STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com)).

The RTSs are all Ravenscar-based, with additional restrictions
`No_Exception_Propagation` and `No_Finalization`.
`No_Exception_Propagation` means that exceptions can't be caught
except in their immediate scope; instead, a `Last_Chance_Handler` is
called.

In each case, the board support for the RTS (configuration for size
and location of Flash, RAM; clock initialization; interrupt naming) is
in `$RTS/adainclude`. Support for the on-chip peripherals is also
included, in Ada spec files generated by SVD2Ada
(https://github.com/AdaCore/svd2ada).

The Ada source is either original or based on FSF GCC (mainly 4.9.1,
some later releases too).

The boards supported are

* `arduino-due` for the Arduino Due.
  * See `arduino-due/COPYING*` for licensing terms.
  * On-chip peripheral support in `atsam3x8e/`.
  * Tests in `test-arduino-due/`.

* `stm32f4` for the STM32F4-DISC* board (and also the Crazyflie).
  * See `stm32f4/COPYING*` for licensing terms.
  * On-chip peripheral support in `stm32f40x/`.
  * Tests in `test-stm32f4/`.

* `stm32f429i` for the STM32F429I-DISC* board.
  * See `stm32f429i/COPYING*` for licensing terms.
  * On-chip peripheral support in `stm32f429x/`.
  * Tests in `test-stm32f429i/`.
