   --  The RTS includes (in startup.adb) a version of this procedure
   --  with pragma Weak_External. This means that if the user code
   --  includes a procedure with this profile it will be linked
   --  instead of the RTS version. Since the RTS version disables the
   --  watchdog, and this version does not, the watchdog will be
   --  running, and after 16 seconds the MCU will reset (and the
   --  orange LED will blink rapidly 5 times before reverting to its
   --  once-per-second behaviour).
