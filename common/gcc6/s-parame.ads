--  This package defines some system dependent parameters for GNAT. These
--  are values that are referenced by the runtime library and are therefore
--  relevant to the target machine.

--  The parameters whose value is defined in the spec are not generally
--  expected to be changed. If they are changed, it will be necessary to
--  recompile the run-time library.

--  The parameters which are defined by functions can be changed by modifying
--  the body of System.Parameters in file s-parame.adb. A change to this body
--  requires only rebinding and relinking of the application.

--  Note: do not introduce any pragma Inline statements into this unit, since
--  otherwise the relinking and rebinding capability would be deactivated.

--  Modified from GCC 4.9.1 for Cortex GNAT RTS.

   function Adjust_Storage_Size (Size : Size_Type) return Size_Type;
   --  Given the storage size specified, return the Storage_Size value

   --    when Size = Unspecified_Size, return Default_Stack_Size
   --    when Size < Minimum_Stack_Size, return Minimum_Stack_Size
   --    otherwise return given Size
