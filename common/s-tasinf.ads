--  This package contains the definitions and routines associated with the
--  implementation and use of the Task_Info pragma. It is specialized
--  appropriately for targets that make use of this pragma.

--  Note: the compiler generates direct calls to this interface, via Rtsfind.
--  Any changes to this interface may require corresponding compiler changes.

--  This unit may be used directly from an application program by providing
--  an appropriate WITH, and the interface can be expected to remain stable.

--  This is the FreeRTOS-Ada version of this module.
