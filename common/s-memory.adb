--  Modified from GCC 4.9.1 as part of the FreeRTOS-Ada port.

--  This implementation assumes that the underlying malloc/free/realloc
--  implementation is thread safe, and thus, no additional lock is required.
--  Note that we still need to defer abort because on most systems, an
--  asynchronous signal (as used for implementing asynchronous abort of
--  task) cannot safely be handled while malloc is executing.

--  If you are not using Ada constructs containing the "abort" keyword, then
--  you can remove the calls to Abort_Defer.all and Abort_Undefer.all from
--  this unit.
